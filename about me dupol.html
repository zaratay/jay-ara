  I have studied computer science and I am very interested in web development. I was 33 years old when i was made my first web page with HTML and css. While i was studying in University,
 I took computer science as my major subject
and was introduced to programming. During my studies I am an active classroom president and 
became an active and responsible
for all kinds of tasks and projects.

                       </p>
                       <p>

  I am highly energetic and motivated person and I love to work as a member or  a leader of ateam.
I specially enjoy working with changing Projects and taking them forward with rapid pace but
high presision.
   I am talkative and sociable but also known
for getting "in the zone" while concentrating on detailed work like programming or designing.
